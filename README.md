# Portfolio Website

## Introduction
For my portfolio, I was inspired by clean and highly minimalist designs, and so decided to pursue that look throughout the design.

My target audience are people looking to recruit me or collaborate with me on projects. Therefore, the site has to portray a highly distilled story of who I am and what I do, that is readable in less than 30 seconds.

To this effect, I decided on a single page scrolling design with bold borders framing each new section.

The sections I will include are "About Me", "Skills", "Work" and "Contact".

## Design
### Considerations
For a clean, readable layout, there must be a good balance of whitespace surrounding elements.

Icons and pictures should be kept to a minimum and be non-distracting. As the site is a scrolling single page, I decided to keep the navigation bar at the top for use only when quick access to one of the sections is needed. The logos at the top of each section are anchored back to the top of the site.

Each section will be framed in a unique colour from the chosen palette and elements within the section will also exhibit the colour to give each section its identity and internal consistency.

### Process
My main contrasting colours are the off-white background against dark navy. To contrast this and add some energy, I went for a variation of pink bordering on orange.

Designing and wireframing was carried out using Figma (http://figma.io). I went through about 3 iterations of designs until, due to time pressure, I settled on a more familiar and achievable design that I could work with.

## Development 
### Process
While getting the design right in Figma took me about 3 days, translating my design to the browser via code was a different ballgame altogether. 

I realised quickly that while I had spent the week before starting on this project learning about CSS, I had done very little practice on actually writing CSS from scratch.

This resulted in a lot of time spent researching and understanding various elements and behaviours of CSS I wanted to implement, as well as a lot of trial and error ensuring what I had designed rendered correctly in the browser.
